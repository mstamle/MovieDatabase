                    </h3>
                    <p>Hasbro and Lionsgate have signed Zoe Saldana for the
                    voice cast of the animated “My Little Pony: The Movie,”
                    Variety has learned exclusively. Previously announced voice
                    cast members include Sia, Liev Schreiber, Taye Diggs, Emily
                    Blunt, Kristin Chenoweth, Uzo Aduba, and Michael Pena.
                    Lionsgate is releasing “My Little Pony” on Oct. 6, 2017.
                    Jayson Thiessen is directing from a screenplay by Meghan
                    McCarthy, writer and producer of the “My Little Pony:
                    Friendship Is Magic” animated series.

                    Mike Tyson Biopic
                    </h3>
                    <p>While Martin Scorsese always seems to have a busy
                    schedule, it might have opened up slightly given the recent
                    revelation that he bailed on that Frank Sinatra biopic. The
                    director’s next picture is expected to be the hitman tale
                    “The Irishman,” which will reteam him with his longtime
                    friend Robert De Niro, but according to Jamie Foxx, Scorsese
                    is still going to make a Mike Tyson biopic.</p>
