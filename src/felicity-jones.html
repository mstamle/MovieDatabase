            <h4>Biography</h4>

                    <p>
                        Felicity Rose Hadley Jones is an English actress. Jones was
                        born in Birmingham, West Midlands, and grew up in
                        Bournville. Her parents met while working at the
                        Wolverhampton Express and Star. Her father was a journalist
                        while her mother was in advertising. They divorced when she
                        was three, and she was brought up with her brother by her
                        mother alone. She has said that her family is still
                        "extremely close." Her uncle is actor Michael Hadley.

                    <p>
                        She started her professional acting career as a child,
                        appearing at age 12 in The Treasure Seekers (1998). She went
                        on to play Ethel Hallow for one series in the television
                        show The Worst Witch and its sequel Weirdsister College.
                        After Kings Norton Girls School, Jones attended King Edward
                        VI Handsworth School, to complete A Levels and went on to
                        take a gap year (during which she appeared in the BBC series
                        Servants (2003)). She took time off from acting to attend
                        school during her formative years, and has worked steadily
                        since she graduated with a 2:1 from Wadham College, Oxford
                        in 2006, where she read English. While studying English, she
                        appeared in student plays, including Attis in which she
                        played the title role, and, in 2005, Shakespeare's "Comedy
                        of Errors" for the OUDS summer tour to Japan, starring
                        alongside Harry Lloyd.
